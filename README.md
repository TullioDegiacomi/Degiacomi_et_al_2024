Each folder contains the input sounding used for the simulation with the WRF-ARW model.

The scripts sounding_plot.py and SkewT_plot.py cn be used to visualize the input soundings.
The script plot_nested_domains.py allows to visualize the idealized orography used in the experiments.
The script Fourier_analysis.py can be used to analyze the precipitation signal using Fourier series.

The scripts Analysis_plots_results.py and Analysis_plot_results_2.py are used to analyze the simulation results and to make the plots.
